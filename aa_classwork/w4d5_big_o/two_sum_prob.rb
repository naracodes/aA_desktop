# Learning Goals
# Be able to reason about a difficult problem and think of ways to solve it.
# Be able to determine and explain the time and space complexity of a method
# Be able to recognize when time or space complexity can be improved
# Know some common tricks to improve time or space complexity

# BRUTE FORCE
# The time complexity for the below method is O(n^2)
def bad_two_sum?(arr, target)
    pairs = arr.combination(2)
    pairs.any? { |pair| pair.sum == target }
end

# SORTING
# With a sorted array, I can use the pointer method, although the pointer performance is O(n) itself, since we had to use
# sort (quicksort) at the beginning, this methodb becomes O(n log (n))
