Phase 1: Naive Solution
One approach to solving this problem would be:

Initialize a local variable current_max_range to nil.
Iterate over the array and consider each window of size w. For each window:
Find the min value in the window.
Find the max value in the window.
Calculate max - min and compare it to current_max_range. Reset the value of current_max_range if necessary.
Return current_max_range.

def windowed_max_range(arr, window_size)
    current_max_range = nil
    (0...arr.length - 1).each do |i|
        if arr[i..(i + 1)]
            
        end
    end
end

windowed_max_range([1, 0, 2, 5, 4, 8], 2) == 4 # 4, 8
windowed_max_range([1, 0, 2, 5, 4, 8], 3) == 5 # 0, 2, 5
windowed_max_range([1, 0, 2, 5, 4, 8], 4) == 6 # 2, 5, 4, 8
windowed_max_range([1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 8], 5) == 6 # 3, 2, 5, 4, 8
